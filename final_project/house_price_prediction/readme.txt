Welcome to Final project of this course that I pass and sharing with you
In this project we use several tasks and for each task use different libraries.
Goal of this project is house price prediction using machine learning method
called 'Linear Regression'.
Machine Learning is base of AI area and of course is a popular and also famous
field of Python that a lot of learner and trainer learn Python for use it data
science field.
In our project first we scrape our data from web and website.
our data are house features and price from Berlin, Germany.
Then store it in a Database, I use MongoDB database.
This is my first time that I use MongoDB and want to try it in this project.
then Give it to train our model with these data and finally create our model.
for notice, in this project we use python Jupyter Notebook.
for more practice, In some notebooks we play with our result.
note: I create this project 3 years ago and its so unprocessed and I just do
it when I pass my course and at end of course for getting familiar with machine
learning area and MongoDB database. so don't use it as a source and just enjoy it.
In future when I working on this ML area more in depth and becoming my expertise, 
I did real project that have principles of ML projects.
