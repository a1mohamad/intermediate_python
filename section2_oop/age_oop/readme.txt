We want to write a program that uses the datetime library class in Python 
to calculate the age of a person. If the input date is incorrect, print 
the word WRONG in the output. The date format is yyyy/mm/dd. (For example, 
if the month is entered as 15, since there are only 12 months, the output 
should print WRONG. The same applies to the number of days, which is a 
maximum of 31)

Note: The input and output of the following example are for running the 
program on 2019/02/01.

input:

1995/02/03

output:

24
