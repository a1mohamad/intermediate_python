Two different health programs are planned in two schools, A and B. 
Milk is distributed in one school and not in the other. Nutrition 
experts plan to compare the height, weight, and age of students in 
these two classes by examining their ages. Write a program that 
takes the number of students in each class, plus their ages, heights, 
and weights, stores each in a list, and prints the average age, 
heights, and weights of each class on a separate line in the output 
(printed as floats), and then prints the class with the highest 
average height in the output. (First, enter the number and information 
of class A, and then the information of class B. The output should 
also be printed in the order of the input information.) If the 
average height is equal, the class with the lowest average weight 
should be printed. If the average height and weight are equal, the 
statement Same should be printed in the output.
Using class is essential in solving the exercise.
