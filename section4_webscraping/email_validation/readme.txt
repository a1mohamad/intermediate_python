We want to write a program that prints OK in the output if the email entered 
by the user is in the following pattern and WRONG if it is not the same as 
the pattern. (The output must be in uppercase.)
The pattern consists of two strings string and an expression expression 
(including a number and a string, the presence of a number and a string at the 
same time is not required and can only include a string.) Separated by @ and ., 
it is considered as the correct email.

expression@string.string
