In a survey of people interested in watching movies, they were asked 
to write down their 3 favorite genres. They were given 6 different 
genres to choose from, including:

Horror, Romance, Comedy, History, Adventure, Action

We want to write a program that takes the number of people, then takes the name 
of each person with the genres they are interested in, and prints the 
name of each genre and the number of people interested in that genre 
in order of greatest interest in the output. (If the level of interest 
in different genres is the same, print it in alphabetical order in the 
output.) If a genre is not selected, consider its value as zero and 
print the name and the number 0 in the output.
