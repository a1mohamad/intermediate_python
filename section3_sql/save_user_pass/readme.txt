We want to write a program that takes email and password as input and 
stores it in MySQL database as username and password. Submit only your 
code file. The code written should be able to enter information as input 
and store and record the information in a desired database file.

It is essential to follow the email format as input. If the input format 
is not in the email format, show the user the correct example and ask the 
user for input again. The password also includes a number and a string.

A valid email pattern is one that includes two strings string and an 
expression expression (including a string or a number and a string at the 
same time) separated by @ and ., as the desired valid email. As follows:
